Averdam is a pastoral world with green life, blue water, white clouds, and more.
It has the atmosphere of a high fantasy setting - medieval technology, magic,
heroes and monsters, and more.
The world's theme is "elements in balance".

<!-- more -->

The world itself creates balance between the elements and other forces.
This includes the classical elements such as earth or fire,
but also more ephemeral things such as "life" or "fate".
Should one force grow too dominant, the world will raise up counteracting forces to even the balance.
If the farmers' realms grow too prosperous, a dark lord will appear.
If the shadow grows too powerful, bands of heroes will arise.
