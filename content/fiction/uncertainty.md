Lucky's been directing movies for 30 years.
I've been acting in them for eight.
So when Lucky asks me to try something new
for the fifth David Dark movie, I go along with it.

<!-- more -->

"David's been backed up by CGI for too long,"
Lucky told me over lunch, waving asparagus crepe
in my face with his fork. "The fans are getting
tired of seeing this stuff. They want reality."

I shook my head. "David Dark can do all that stuff. I can't.
I'm on egg whites and rice every day, in the gym
every day, but I can't break the laws of physics."

Lucky just grinned at me. "Leave that to me."

The device was called the Moravec-Marchal Wave Selection
Prototype. It was experimental. When Lucky took me to his
scientist friend to have it fitted, I asked what it did.

"Basically, it's a device that provides quantum immortality."
Noticing my blank stare, he went on. "Your heartbeat is
measured by the device and broadcast backward in time, via
probability wave. The device selects for futures where your
heart rate stays below a pre-set interval. No worse than
hard cardiovascular exercise. In situations where multiple
outcomes are possible, the device constrains your wave
function to those where the heartbeat remains under this
threshold."

I stared. "You mean I can't be killed as long as I wear this thing?"

"That's the idea."

----

The assistant director was with me in the airplane. The device
was humming away on my chest, tucked neatly beneath my tuxedo.
Below the airplane were the Alps. Behind us was the camera crew
in a helicopter.

"The script is very specific. In this scene, you're going to leap
out of the plane," yelled the A.D. over the roar of the engines.
"David's going to leap out of the plane, shoot out the right
engine, and come down on the mountain in the snow while the plane
crashes. We're not doing any CGI here, so you have to follow the
script. Okay?"

"That's great, but what about you guys?" I joked. My nervousness
made the joke fall flat, but the A.D. didn't seem to notice.

"All you have to do is jump. Just jump when you feel like it,
pop a couple rounds at the plane. The second unit is handling
the engine failure and crash. Don't worry about it!"

Worrying about it was all I could do. I made sure the harness
was on for the fifteenth time, looked at the steady green light
for comfort, and got a grip on the prop guns. The open door was
waiting for me. After a few moments, my gut twisted - this felt
right. So I dove out, and unloaded.

I came down in the thickest snow on the mountain. I could see
the chopper spiraling in for a close-up, with Lucky giving me a
big thumbs-up through the transparent canopy. As I pulled myself
out of the snowbank, I let my disgust with him play out on my face,
using it in place of David's contempt for the bad guys on the downed
plane. "Cut and print!" called Lucky over the megaphone. Then came
the rope ladder and my ride home.

----

"I have to keep wearing it?" I demanded.

Lucky looked apologetic. "The insurance company, once they heard
about this, were very specific. On-set accidents are a big deal.
You know last year, Tom Cruise was almost killed by falling lumber?
Tom Cruise. Imagine what we'd do without a real actor like you, Ed.
The movie industry just can't afford to lose you."

"Literally," I grumbled. "Is 'afford' all they care about? All you
care about? I thought we were friends, Lucky. Now you're clamping
this thing around me like a ball and chain."

"It's just until post-production," he begged. "Please, Ed, please
understand. Look, you aren't the only one. They're making Kate
wear it, and she's not even doing her own stunts. They had to throw
out all the old gowns for the Prague scene. We're ordering new ones
to hide the device. You aren't the only one suffering, believe me.
Look, it's a good script. A great one. The best David Dark we've
ever done. And we're working with some really good people, like
Chris and Kate. Come on, you always told me you wanted a good script,
that you didn't want a bunch of mindless action movies. Think how far
we've come, and do it for the script."

"Fine. But just until post."

----

Lucky found me staring down a pile of white powder.

"What the *fuck* are you doing?" he demanded. I'd never heard his
voice pitch so high. Then again, if he had any idea how much I'd
paid for this crap...

"I thought I was overdosing on cocaine," I explained, and quite
calmly I thought. The look on his face wasn't encouraging, but
I plowed ahead anyway. He deserved to know what he'd unleashed
on the world.

"I paid a fair street price to a dealer for this cocaine. I bought
out his entire supply. All of it. Then I started snorting."

He couldn't cope. He needed the implications assembled for him.

"Lucky, this isn't cocaine. It's flour. White flour. I've been
snorting bread."

He breathed a huge sigh of relief. I saw the line of reasoning,
clear as crystal, and cut him off quickly before his mind could
latch onto the safe conclusion and call it truth.

"No, this isn't a joke, Lucky. I'm deadly serious. I intended
to buy cocaine. I intended to kill myself -- if I could. The
fact that it wasn't cocaine, *that it was not cocaine*, was
not part of my plan. This caused it." And I tapped the device
strapped to my chest, still operating at peak efficiency.

"What?" He was slowly coming round to it, but he needed that
extra push.

"Lucky. I can't kill myself while your friend's device is working.
It *retroactively changed the world around me* to keep me alive."
I pulled the blanket off the dozen or so pistols I'd been hiding
from lot security and showed them to him. "What are the odds that
all of these would jam as well, eh? One hundred percent."

I could see him rallying, finally. Maybe I was getting through.
The next few words removed that faint hope.

"Ed, thank goodness. Trying to kill yourself is crazy. The
device saved your life!"

"It saved my existence, Lucky. My life is out of my hands."

----

I still remember the headline. "Congress mandates immortality device".
I remember testifying at the hearings. Mainly I remember all the
letters people wrote to me, thanking me for being a pioneer in testing
a device that would save every life on the planet. More like every life
in America, or every life that could afford to buy one of these things.
I remember these things every time I get up in the morning and check
the settings on my Moravec-Marchal Wave Selection Production model.

There's no more unexpected violence. There's no accidents. People go
to work, they come home. Brake lines don't fail on the highway. Kids
don't pull guns out of their parents' closets and play with them.
Salmonella outbreaks are caught before they happen. The President is
already talking about deploying troops to the Middle East, and the
opposition is already blasting him over intelligence that Iran is
researching their own prototype. But if they succeed, great. Doesn't
that mean the end of war?

I remember when I met my wife. My heart rate shot way up, and stayed
there the whole time she was in the room. Given the calibrations mandated
by the insurance industry, I wonder. Does that mean love at first sight
isn't happening any more? The possibility of meeting your soul mate,
washed away by quantum wave collapse?

It's the beginning of the end for free will. What you're allowed to do
is dictated by a piece of ceramic and metal strapped to your chest.
That's a small price to pay for world peace, they keep telling me.

At the end of the day, I guess things aren't that different for me.
Just follow the script. It's a good script.
