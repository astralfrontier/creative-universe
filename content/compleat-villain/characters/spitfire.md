A Golden Age hero with a jetpack. This version of the character is from a Golden Age game, but there's a modern-era Innocent version of the same concept.

# Background

## When did you first put on the mask? Why?

Vic's big brother Andrew Davis "Andy" Venture was a member of the elite Rocket Rangers. Andy's "Icarus Potential" gene gave him heightened abilities and a three-dimensional orienteering sense. When Andy came home from the war, he hung up his jet pack and Z-Gun to become a shoe salesman, and married his high school sweetheart and singer Dinah Holiday.

Vic had been a "scrapper" during the war, collecting recyclables and salvaging discarded materials for the war effort. In that time, he'd seen the crime on the streets of Halcyon. The war might have ended, but crime hadn't. What was Andy doing, just giving up? Vic took his jet pack in secret, strapped it on, and adopted the nickname "Spitfire". Sure, he might not have the training. But he has the Icarus gene too, and the determination to save people!

## Why do you keep a secret identity?

The Rocket Rangers were, of course, super duper top secret. Andy can't talk about it (except with a few war buddies that come to visit him now and again). Plus, Andy would be upset if he knew Vic was using the jet pack. That's why it's extra important that it doesn't come out. He'd be compromising a United States military secret. But more importantly, he'd be letting Andy down.

Of course, his big brother's smart. That's why Vic built a fake jet pack out of scrap he'd collected, and left it where he'd taken the original pack. As long as Andy doesn't try to fly, he'll never know!

## Who, outside of the team, knows about your dual identity?
Doctor Daedalus, the discoverer of the Icarus Potential, and inventor of the jet pack and Z-Gun. When Vic flew out to Zeppelin Zero, the former base of the Rocket Rangers, the good Doctor was still there. 

He taught Vic how the Z-Gun can absorb energy, which is fed into the jet pack to generate thrust. Vic still isn't sure why the Doctor hasn't told anyone. Or maybe he has? Either way, he's been supportive.

## Who thinks the worst of your masked identity?
Aldous Ashton, a writer and journalist, who condemned the role of superheroes in the War. His firebrand columns denounce the Rocket Rangers, including Spitfire, calling for civilian law enforcement and peacekeeping efforts to take over. Ashton knows Mr. Venture (Vic's father) socially, and has visited their house on occasion, but Vic doesn't know how they're connected.

## Why do you care about the team?
Well, all these people seem to have something to do with the war, somehow or other. Maybe they can give me some pointers on how to go about doing this hero thing!
