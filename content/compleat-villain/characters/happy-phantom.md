He's lonely and directionless, with some notion of "doing good" but no clear direction and no friends to anchor him. He lacks financial support and must rely on theft or donations to get by. He can consciously use his powers, but they activate on their own during moments of great stress or fear.

# Background

## How did you gain your skills?
At home, I got hit and passed out. That wasn't the first time. But this time, I just - disappeared. I thought I was dead. My folks looked for me and couldn't find me. I thought they'd killed me, though, so I ran away. But I don't know _how_ it happened.

## When did you first put on your costume?
When I got hungry, and stopped being afraid, and came back outta ghost form. I realized I was still mortal, but I had a power now, and I could _pretend_ to be a ghost. And I didn't want my folks finding me again.

## Who, outside of the team, thinks you shouldn’t be a superhero?
There's an adult hero who thinks I'm silly and stupid and keeps telling me not to go out and do what I do. And I dunno, they seem pretty strong, and I worry...

## Why do you try to be a hero?
What happened to me shouldn't happen to anyone. Being away from that situation, though, it was so liberating. I never felt so free before! And I want to share that too.

## Why do you care about the team?
