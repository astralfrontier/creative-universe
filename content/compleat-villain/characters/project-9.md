A mysterious alien whose true form is an ever-changing blur, due to their extension into 3D space from the hyperdimension. But they can take on humanoid forms to interact with people. They're an entertainer by profession, and are trying to continue that here on Earth.

# Background

## Where do you come from?

I am from another galaxy! It's a world of light and life and excitement! We evolved from the paramagnetic remnants of a star cluster, developing intelligence over eons. I'm not really into science, but that's what I learned. Your static scientists keep asking me for details I just don't know, and they seem really frustrated I can't answer more. Sorry!

## Why did you come to Earth?

We were experimenting with a new dimensional lens for my performance, only it totally missed and uh, I'm in this other galaxy now. This is totally the fault of my technical team.

Well, I guess there was this static experiment going on at the same time, called "Project 9", trying to make contact with distant extraterrestrial life. That's where I got my name from! So maybe it's not the tech team's fault.

## Why do you want to stay here (for now at least)?

Well, this is a whole new place. This whole "planet" thing is a novelty to me, and you statics get boring to look at after awhile, but you've got performances and entertainers here too, so I think I can make that work!

## Why do your people want you to come home?

They're _so_ worried. You see, we're entertainers, not first contact specialists. The important ones back home say I'm supposed to leave this up to the experts. But I'm a performer! If making close connections with people isn't my job, what is?

Plus they've kept the lens focused on me and now my life here is a reality show so I'm mega popular or something.

So is the team, by the way.

## Why do you care about the team?

I guess most statics can't do things like I can do, so I'm putting my native abilities to good use. Plus, my normal shows are a total loss on you all, so they're helping me learn what impresses people here.
