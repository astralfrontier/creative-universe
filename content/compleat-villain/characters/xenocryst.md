An archaeologist's child transformed into an earth elemental by a chthonic god, and now bound to them in a rocky relationship.

# Background

## Who were you before?
My parents are archaeologists. My brother and I accompanied them around the world, and learned about the past first-hand.

## When did you change? What caused it?
We were in the underground temple complex when an earthquake hit. Everything fell in. I was crying, and I could hear voices that I thought were my family.

The ancient spirit of the temple, named Xuzotl, heard my plea. They offered power, in exchange for my life and the lives of my family. I accepted. It turned me into this rocky monster, and the chthonic god now dwells in my soul. But we survived.

## Who, outside of the team, is helping you understand your new body?
My parents are doing everything they can to learn the lore of Xuzotl, so we can appease the god and finally lift the curse. Unfortunately they're trying all kinds of weird and embarrassing experiments on me, and my brother refuses to acknowledge me outside of the house.

## Why don’t you just try to hide yourself away? 
Xuzotl won't let me. The earth-god has an agenda, but won't tell me what it is. They just keep pushing me into new and weird situations as part of this pact I made. Plus, every so often, they suspend the curse and turn me human again. But only for their own purposes. Plus, they'll restore the transformation without any warning, at any time.

## Why do you care about the team? 
Sometimes, I get so angry, and I start breaking things. And maybe they'll help me understand if that's Xuzotl affecting my behavior... or if that's just me.
