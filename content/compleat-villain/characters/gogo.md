A delivery driver who drank the wrong vial of Super-Soldier serum.

# Background

## When did you first put on the mask? Why?
Jacques Rabbit, a human-animal supersoldier turned mercenary supervillain, stole my car one time! He left behind a vial of serum, mixing galago, axolotl, and wrasse DNA. I kept it from the cops, and eventually drank it, turning into a hybrid supersoldier myself!

Why take it? I guess… having my car stolen was so exciting for a few moments, and then after I had to go to the police and do all the boring stuff, it was so DULL. I wanted the excitement I felt then.

## Why do you keep a secret identity?
If Jacques Rabbit ever found out it was me that took the serum, he'd come back and hurt my family! Plus, my little bro Mo gets bullied enough already.

## Who, outside of the team, knows about your dual identity?

I went to the school's chemistry teacher, Dr. Emilio Blasto, for help in controlling my transformations! I had to talk to him about the shifting, and he gave me tips on how to maintain self-control.

## Who thinks the worst of your masked identity?

Aside from Jacques Rabbit, I got spotted as Gogo one time wearing a school jersey, so now the school newspaper thinks they were making fun of the school (our school animal is an Eagle) and constantly writes articles trashing me.

## Why do you care about the team?

The team is a bunch of fun weirdos and I finally have somewhere I can be myself! Whoever that is...
